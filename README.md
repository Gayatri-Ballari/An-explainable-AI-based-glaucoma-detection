# An-explainable-AI-based-glaucoma-detection
Automated detection of glaucoma using deep learning technique and provide Explain-ability technique to help us better understands our model's predictions, and how we could further improve its performance.




Glaucoma is an eye disease caused by elevated intra-ocular pressure. This elevated pressure destroys the optic nerve. Your eye constantly makes aqueous humor. As new aqueous flows into your eye, the same amount should drain out. Glaucoma is caused by increased fluid pressure on the optic nerve leading to irreversible, permanent blindness. Early detection is essential to prevent loss of vision. In this project, automated detection of glaucoma using optic disk and optic cup using deep learning/machine learning techniques.. In this work, a baseline ResNet50 will be trained, evaluate the model, and use SHAP model explainability technique to help us better understand our model's predictions, and how we could further improve its performance. SHAP (Shapley Additive explanation) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. The result obtained with deep learning based ResNet50 model and the accuracy obtained is 99.04%.
